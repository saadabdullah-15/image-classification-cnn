# Image Classifier using CNN

## Project Description
This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify images into different categories. The dataset is preprocessed, augmented, and used to train a deep learning model.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images.
- It is stored in the `data/` directory or can be downloaded from an external source (Google Drive/Kaggle).
- Preprocessing steps include normalization and augmentation.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier-cnn.git
   cd image-classifier-cnn
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Running the Project
To train and evaluate the model, execute the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Image_Classifier_CNN.ipynb
```

## Model Training & Evaluation
- The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Performance metrics include accuracy and loss.
- The trained model can be saved and used for inference.

## Future Improvements
- Implement data augmentation techniques.
- Fine-tune the model with transfer learning.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
